# sdc-frontend

This is the nginx frontend for the steemit.com app. It runs in it's own docker container alongside the steemit.com app.

Required environment variables:

```
$SERVER_NAME     # ex. steemit.com
$WSPA_SERVER     # ex. steemd.steemit.com
```

TODO: elaborate in README, setup automated build, and rename when steemit.com/sdc app gets an official name
